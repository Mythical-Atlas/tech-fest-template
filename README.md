# Java Template for the Tech Fest Coding Challenge

Programmed by Ben Correll from Concordia Lutheran High School

Basically, use this if you want to win.



Written for Java 12 (although unless java WILDLY changes after v.12, it will probably work with subsequent versions)

HIGHLY recommend you use the Eclipse IDE for this template. If you're using Dr. Java or Netbeans or something: only God can help you now.



Write your challenge-specific code in Loader.java.



This template is mostly just helpful for reading/writing to a file and parsing the input data.

All known challenges use either strings or integers for the input + output so those are the only data types supported.

However, if they include other data types in future Tech Fests, the template allows for expansion.



If you're using this after 2021 (the year I graduate), you can probably contact me at ben@robertcorrell.com if you need help. I'll be impressed if this template lasts that long, though.
